# Brick-Breaker-Game
### Project Overview
Brick Breaker: Arcade Rush is a classic arcade-style game built using Python and Pygame. The player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and destroy all the bricks. The game increases in difficulty with each level, adding more bricks and increasing ball speed. The game ends if the ball touches the bottom edge of the screen.

### Features
1) Smooth paddle and ball movement
2) Dynamic level progression with increasing difficulty
3) Brick collision and destruction logic
4) Game over screen and restart capability
5) Clean UI with colored bricks and paddle
6) Object-Oriented Design using Python classes

### Controls
Action	Key
1) Move Left	← (Left Arrow)
2) Move Right	→ (Right Arrow)
3) Restart Game	R (after game over)

### Concepts Covered
1) Game loops using pygame.time.Clock
2) Collision detection (paddle, ball, brick)
3) Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python
4) Level system and reset logic
5) Drawing with pygame.Rect and shapes
6) Event handling in pygame

### How to Run the Game
Prerequisites:
Python 3.x installed
pygame library installed (pip install pygame)

### Steps:
Step 1: Save the code in a file named brick_breaker.py.

Step 2: 
Run the game using:
bash
Copy
Edit
python brick_breaker.py
Step 3: Use the arrow keys to move the paddle and break all the bricks. Try to survive and progress through increasing levels!
